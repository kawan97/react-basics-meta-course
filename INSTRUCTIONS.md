# Getting Started

If you try to run this app at this point you will get a notification that reads: "webpack compiled with 1 error and 1 warning".

Don't worry about this error. What it means is that the app cannot compile because you still need to add the missing named import, like the code comment on line 2 of App.js instructs.

You are now ready to start working on your app. Follow the comments in the code! They are your instructions of how you need to make this app work. For example, once you've added the imports, you should be able to run the app. It still needs work, but at least it can run.


## Steps

In this assessment, your goal is to build a functioning calculator app.  Starter code has been provided for you in the `App.js` file.

Your goal is to use this starting code and extend it with missing pieces to make the app behave as expected: a fully working simple calculator app.  Happy coding!
